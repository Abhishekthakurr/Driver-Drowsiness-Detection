# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection
**Driver Drowsiness Detection using Machine Learning**

### Overview
This project aims to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness using machine learning techniques. Driver drowsiness is a significant factor in road accidents, and timely detection can prevent potentially fatal consequences. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can analyze facial features and driver behavior to accurately identify signs of drowsiness and issue alerts to the driver.

### Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: The system continuously monitors the driver's facial expressions and behavior in real-time.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze facial features and detect signs of drowsiness.
- **Alert Mechanism**: Issues alerts to the driver when signs of drowsiness are detected, potentially preventing accidents.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for easy interaction and understanding of the system's status.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main script to start the drowsiness detection system.
4. Follow the instructions provided to calibrate the system and begin monitoring.
